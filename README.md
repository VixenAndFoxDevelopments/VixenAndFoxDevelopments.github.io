# About Me
I am a Independant freelance Game and app developer for windows and andiod who can code in Python, Java Script, C#, and C++, I am based in South Africa and as such cant use geoblocked/US-only aplications. I am a hard working ethical man who will do everything in my power to make sure that your app or game is perfect for your use scenario.
#

# pricing
I am keen to help in anyway possible whether it be an app or a game, you will be able to have your projects done on time with precision and speed, If your code is needing custom paid-for libaries that will be factored into the pricing, as well as a general cost that will added on for the complexity of your app. For pupblishing of the apps it is legaly required for you to give creddit, if creddit is not given and you claim the app as developed by yourself i will have no choise but to terminate your app and any future work with you.
#

# what have i done
I have made 3 mobile apps and games of my own ideas that have gone on to get 100+ downloads in a month, if you have a beter idea than mine your app or game will out perform all the competeters for a cheaper price. I have also made 7 discords bots for monetering servers, preventing spam, auto age verification, auto geolocation and time of day for user bots. . I have worked on the backend networking code for a IP-Logger that emebeds links into picturs and can then find ip's like that.

It deppends on how complex the app is and what libaries you are using, in comparison to a formal company i am a almost free

#### How long will it take

Again it realy deppends on how complex it is, it may just be a few days and it may be a month in the working
